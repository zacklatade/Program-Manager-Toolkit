# Student Bulk Exit

Now, let’s say that a student has left the school and you now need to do a Bulk Student Exit. _**Please know this works best if the student is no longer at school (they left school)**_. This will unenroll the student from all sections INCLUDING ELT. And you will have to submit a service desk to get them added back. If they are **no longer in school**, follow the steps below.

1.	From the CYSH Home Page, you will *click on the Students Tab*.
