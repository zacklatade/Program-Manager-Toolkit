# Transferring Focus List Students

The reason you don’t want to choose the option that the Corps Member has left City Year or de-activate a prior ACM’s section, is because it allows Mid-Years  to take on the prior Corps Members students. If the students have been exited, the Mid-Year will not be able to take on those students in CYSH. Therefore, you will keep those sections active and if/when a Mid-Year comes in and takes on those students you can Transfer that section to them.
