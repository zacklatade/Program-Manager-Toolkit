# Adding Focus List Students

If you are trying to add focus list student(s). Follow the next steps to do so. 

**Please know if you are adding a student to any section, you must add them into the DESSA section. That way they are rated for the Middle of the Year and End of Year DESSA Evaluations.**


# Steps After Adding a Focus List Student

Once you have added a student to a focus list that was not part of the Initial Focus List, you will need to send in a Help Desk Ticket letting IA know that you need to have them added to SAM. That way they can be tested and evaluated to make sure they can be on a Focus List. If the student tests proficient or advanced, please remove them and add a new focus list student to repeat the process. Do not add more than needed at a time.
