# Transferring Focus List Students

The reason you don’t want to choose the option that the Corps Member has left City Year or de-activate a prior ACM’s section, is because it allows Mid-Years  to take on the prior Corps Members students. If the students have been exited, the Mid-Year will not be able to take on those students in CYSH. Therefore, you will keep those sections active and if/when a Mid-Year comes in and takes on those students you can Transfer that section to them.

1. You will start by opening up CYschoolhouse.

3.	You will select the section that you will be transferring over. This should be the section of the Corps Member that had left. This section should still be active and have all the students still active as well. 

4.	Once you open the section up you will click on the “Edit”  button.

5.	The Edit Button will bring you to the page and you will edit the name in the “Intervention Primary Staff”. You will erase the current name and input the new Corps Member that will be taking over that section.
